# Bruins_Start_Fires
A simple script that leverages pre-downloaded and formatted csvs and internal COB data to analyze the Boston Bruins' effect on 911 calls made in Boston. One should be able to find the csvs in the repository as well as a link to their source in the code comments.

This is meant to serve as a simple code sample and/or analysis example.
